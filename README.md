# Call-Center-Data-Analysis

In this virtual internship program, there were 4 major tasks that needed to be performed for gaining practical experience in learning PowerBI and also leveraging aspects of data visualization through dashboards and reports.

## Task: Examine the transparency through KPIs and insights of Call Center Data Trends and Analysis of a telecom company for the first quarter of the year.

In this task, we were given a call centre dataset. The task is to analyze the call centre trends such as -

+ Overall customer satisfaction

+ Overall calls answered/abandoned

+ Calls by time

+ Average speed of answer, and

+ Agent's performance

Building a dashboard using Power Bi gives us more clarity about how actual work happens in Real-time by solving real case problems, it was a challenge as well as very exciting to learn.

Here is a dashboard I created for a telecom client-
